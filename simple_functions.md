# simple_functions
Defining simple functions that do a variety of tasks, including:
   - Compute the ceiling of a number (the next greater integer, unless already an integer).
   - Compute the floor of a number (the next smaller integer, unless already an integer).
   - Compute the area of a circle. 
   - Compute the volume of a sphere. 
   - Compute the area of a rectangle.
   - Compute the volume of a box, using its length, width and height.
   - A function called “censor” which replaces all but the first and last characters in a string      with *’s.
